##Filler00 - Guess the Card

A simple "guess the card" game. Just PHP and jQuery, with Bootstrap + Fontawesome for optional flair.

### Demo

[Click to View](http://code.filler00.com/guess-the-card/)

### Install

Upload the 'index.php' and 'js > main.js' files to your website, ideally into their own directory. 

Optionally upload 'css > main.css' if you want to use some of the styles from the demo.

Some other styles and functionality are from the Bootstrap and Fontawesome CDN links - keep or remove them as you please, but keep in mind that the tooltips are from Bootstrap. 

To configure the game options, just open up 'index.php' and change the settings at the top of the file. Each "answer" must have a corresponding "hint", "card", and "placeholder".

### Support
